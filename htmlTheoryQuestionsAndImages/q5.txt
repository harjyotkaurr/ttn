QUESTION 5: Why do we use meta tags?


Meta tags are used in HTML to provide metadata about a webpage. This metadata helps browsers, search engines, and social media platforms understand the content and behavior of the page.They are mainly used for
1. SEO (Search Engine Optimization): Improve search engine rankings with keywords and descriptions.  
2. Responsive Design:Control viewport settings for mobile-friendly layouts.  
3.Social Media:Enhance content previews when shared on platforms like Facebook or Twitter.  

Example: 
<meta charset="UTF-8">
<meta name="description" content="Learn web development with easy tutorials.">
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
