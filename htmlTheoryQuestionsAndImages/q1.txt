QUESTION 1- What is HTML, and how is an HTML document structured?




HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It provides a way to define the layout of a page using various tags and attributes. These tags specify different sections of the page, such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other elements.

HTML5:
HTML5 is the latest version of HTML and comes with a variety of improvements and new features. Its main aim was to enhance support for multimedia (like audio and video) and modern web applications.

1. New Structural Elements: HTML5 introduced semantic tags to make the structure of web pages clearer:
   header, footer, main, aside

2. Multimedia Support: HTML5 added built-in support for embedding multimedia without requiring third-party plugins like 
   audio, video

Structure of an HTML Document:
An HTML document follows a specific structure made up of nested elements.

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration at the top of the document specifies the HTML version being used.
  
<html>: The root element that wraps the entire content of the HTML document.

<head>: This section contains meta-information about the page, such as the title, character encoding, and links to stylesheets or scripts.

<body>: The section that holds the visible content of the web page, such as text, images, and other media.

Simple HTML Document Example:

<html>
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Simple HTML Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Simple HTML Page</h1>
    <p>This is a paragraph on the page.</p>
</body>
</html>
