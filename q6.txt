QUESTION 6: What are IDs and classes in HTML, and how do they differ?

IDs and Classes in HTML are used to identify and style elements using CSS or manipulate them with JavaScript.

ID:
Unique Identifier:Each ID must be unique within a page.It is used to target specific elements.
Uses `#` to target (e.g., `#header`).
Easy to select with `getElementById()`.

Example:  
html
<div id="header">Welcome!</div>

<style>
  #header { color: blue; }
</style>
Class:
It is a reusable identifier which can be assigned to multiple elements.
Used to apply the same style or behavior to multiple elements.
Uses `.` to target (e.g., `.highlight`).
Select with `getElementsByClassName()` or `querySelectorAll()`.

Example:  
<p class="highlight">Important text 1.</p>
<p class="highlight">Important text 2.</p>

<style>
  .highlight { background-color: yellow; }
</style>

Difference between them:
An ID is a unique identifier assigned to a single element on a webpage. It is primarily used when you need to style or manipulate a specific element, as it has higher specificity in CSS. IDs are selected using the `#` symbol in CSS and can be accessed in JavaScript with `getElementById()`. For example, `<div id="header">` targets only one unique header on the page.

In contrast, a class is a reusable identifier that can be applied to multiple elements, making it ideal for applying the same style or behavior to a group of elements. Classes are selected using the `.` symbol in CSS and accessed in JavaScript with `getElementsByClassName()` or `querySelectorAll()`. For instance, `<p class="highlight">` can be used on multiple paragraphs to give them a uniform style.

While IDs offer higher specificity in CSS, making them override class styles when both are applied, classes provide greater flexibility due to their reusability across multiple elements.
