QUESTION 2: What are data types in Javascript? Explain the different types of data types with examples.


JavaScript is loosely-typed, means variables can hold different data types. It is dynamic, case-sensitive language.
In Javascript, data types are broadly categorized into 2 types:-
a) Primitive Data types
b) Non - Primitive Data types

Primitive Data types- They are immutable and hold single values.
String: Represents textual data. Example:
let name = "Aarav";

Number: Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Example:
let age = 25;
let price = 99.99;

BigInt: Used for very large integers beyond the safe limit of the number type.Example:
let bigNumber = 12345678901234567890n;

Boolean: Represents logical values like true and false. Example:
let isStudent = true;

Undefined: A variable declared but it does not have any value assigned to it.Example:
let score;
console.log(score);

Null: Represents an intentional absence of any value.Example:
let data = null;


Non - Primitive data types: They are mutable, dynamic and can store multiple values.

Object: It is used to store key-value pairs. Example:
let trainee = {
  name: "Harjyot",
  age: 21
};

Array: A special type of object to store ordered collections. Example:
let fruits = ["Mango", "Banana", "Apple"];

Function:It is a block of reusable code. Example:
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

Date:It represents date and time. Example:
let today = new Date()
